# MedianImage
Simple script to take out moving parts of an image and just get the background.

# Example
Let's say you have frog statue, a glove, and a dog statue that are constantly getting in
the way of your picture. You can form just the background image by running this script on what you have.

The script removes all inconsistent parts of the images.
